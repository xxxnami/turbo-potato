Description

File Converter is a very simple tool which allows you to convert and compress one or several file(s) using the context menu in windows explorer. And it's FREE!

The interface is designed to be as light as possible to keep the application pleasant to use.

It supports a lot of different file formats:
	Supported output formats 	Compatible input formats
Audio 	flac, aac, ogg, mp3, wav 	3gp, aiff, ape, avi, bik, cda, flac, flv, m4a, mkv, mov, mp3, mp4, oga, ogg, wav, webm, wma, wmv
Video 	webm, mkv, mp4, ogv, avi, gif 	3gp, avi, bik, flv, gif, m4v, mkv, mp4, mpeg, mov, ogv, webm, wmv
Image 	png, jpg, ico, webp 	bmp, exr, ico, jpg, jpeg, png, psd, svg, tiff, tga, webp, pdf, doc*, docx*, odt*, odp*, ods*, ppt*, pptx*, xls*, xlsx*
Document 	pdf 	doc*, docx*, odt*, odp*, ods*, ppt*, pptx*, xls*, xlsx*, bmp, exr, ico, jpg, jpeg, png, psd, svg, tiff, tga

* You need to have Microsoft Office installed and activated in order to convert Office documents.

You can heavily customize the application in order to add / remove conversion presets in the files context menus or edit the existing one to change the conversion options.

If you want more informations about the features offered in File Converter, visit the documentation page.

I hope this application will help you :)

It is open source (GLP v3), free and without any adds so you just have to enjoy it!
